## 📌 About This Repository

Welcome to **`gfg-solutions`** 👋  

This repository is a **daily problem-solving journal** where I consistently solve **GeeksforGeeks (GFG) problems** with a strong focus on:

- 🧠 **Core DSA concepts**
- 💡 **Clear Intitution Concept building**
- ⚙️ **Clean,human-readable, interview-ready code**
- 📈 **Consistency through daily Problem Solving**

Rather than just storing solutions, this repo documents:
* **How to approach a problem**
* **Why an approach works**
* **What patterns and techniques to learn**
---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Strengthen **DSA fundamentals from basics to advanced**
* Improve **problem-solving and analytical thinking**
* Prepare for **coding interviews and online assessments**
* Maintain a daily **GFG practice streak**
* Build a well-structured **DSA knowledge base**

## 🗓️ Daily Streak Philosophy

📅 **One day = One problem**

For each daily problem:
- A **separate folder** is created
- Each folder represents **one day of practice**
- Covers:
  - Problem understanding
  - Core intuition
  - Brute-force and optimal approaches
  - Edge cases
  - Time & space complexity
  - Clean implementations in multiple langugaes

This ensures **deep learning instead of surface-level** solving.
---

🧠 What You’ll Find in Each Problem Folder

✔ Problem description & link
✔ Topics and concepts involved
✔ Step-by-step intuition
✔ Multiple approaches (where applicable)
✔ Pseudocode
✔ Dry run examples
✔ Optimized solution
✔ Time & space complexity analysis
✔ Interview-friendly explanations

---

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- **C++** – STL-based, efficient, competitive programming style  
- **Java** – Clean OOP-based, interview-focused style  
- **Python** – Readable, concise, and beginner-friendly

Each solution is written to be:
- Easy to understand
- Easy to revise
- Safe from unnecessary shortcuts

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- 🔥 Daily problems added consistently
- 🟢 Repository updated regularly
- 📊 Focus on **clarity and learning**, not just problem count

---

## 🤝 Contribution & Usage
